# 👋 Hey there, I'm Thejanu Shanthusha!

Welcome to my digital space.  
I'm a **future-ready full-stack developer** fueled by curiosity, passion, and just the right amount of caffeine. Whether it's crafting sleek interfaces or architecting behind-the-scenes logic, I thrive on building things that live and breathe on the web.

Oh, and when I’m not writing code you'll probably find me dominating in-game lobbies. 🎮

## 🌐 About Me

- 💻 I'm currently diving deep into full-stack web development and loving every bit of the journey.
- 🎯 I enjoy building clean, functional, and user-friendly web apps from the ground up.
- 🎮 Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll find me deep in a game. I'm a **hardcore gamer** at heart.
- 🚀 I’m always exploring new concepts, improving my skills, and pushing myself with new challenges.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

- 📁 Personal projects and web experiments  
- 🎮 Classic game remakes using JavaScript  
- 💡 Practice projects from my development journey  
- 🧪 Code snippets, mini apps, and explorations

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Build more full-stack apps with authentication and user roles  
- Contribute to open-source and collaborate with other devs  
- Become a confident back-end and front-end contributor
- Launch a personal portfolio site
